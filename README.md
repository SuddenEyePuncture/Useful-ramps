# Useful-ramps
Mod for CDDA. Now you can build ramps almost anywhere you want!

What do the ramps do?
Ramps are used to move you and vehicles across Z-levels. It's build of two parts: low and high ends.

How do I use it?
First, find or build low and high ends of a ramp. If you're at a lower level and the ramp leads to a higher level, you should move from the lower end to the higher end. Do the opposite if you're on the higher level.

How do I build it?
Go to the construction menu, go to digging tab and find low and high ends of a ramp. You should have all necessary resources, instruments and a flat surface (floor, rock floor, roof, etc.). Firstly, you have to build low end of ramp on a lower level, then a high end on the same level.
For example, I want to have a ramp between a ground level (0) and a roof (1). Firstly I build a lower end of the ramp at level 0, 1 tile away from the roof. Secondly, I build a higher level of the ramp close to the roof. If your vehicle is 1 tile wide or you don't plan to park a vehicle on the roof, that's enough. In other cases your ramp have to be at least as wide as your vehicle.
In the end it would look like this:
/////  (wall on level 0, roof on level 1)
<<<<<  (high end of a ramp)
>>>>>  (low end of a ramp)
Such ramp could move vehicles up to 5 tiles wide.

What have you changed?
Vanilla ramps require small pits to be constructed, making it impossible to build it underground or on the roof. I've made an alternative recipe without a small pit as a necessity.
